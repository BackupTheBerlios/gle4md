          --  GLE thermostat parameters library  --
   
 This package contains an extensive collection of parameters to 
be used in colored-noise thermostats for molecular-dynamics 
simulations.  Each parameters set is labelled by a syntetic code,
in the form xx_y-z, as described below.
If you make use of these parameters, please report the code
and the scaling you have adopted, and cite the present work, and
the relevant ones between

       *           Description of files           *

 Parameters are divided in folders depending on the fitting style:
opt-kv/      par. fitted to optimize the sampling of potential energy
             (best choice to sample static properties)
opt-kh/      par. fitted to optimize the sampling of total energy
             (best choice for initial equilibration)
cpmd/	     par. fitted for weak coupling with fast modes
             (to be used in CPMD or for dynamical shell models)
quantum/     par. fitted to reproduce nuclear quantum effects
             (non-thermal noise, consider carefully limitations)
delta/       par. fitted for delta-thermostatted dynamics
             (non-thermal noise, selective phonon heating)

 Each set of parameters is labelled after the details of the fitting,
according to the scheme xxx_y-z. 

xxx is a shorthand of the style of the fitting, respectively 
    kv  -  kh  -  cp-n  -  qt
    the "n" in cp-n is the slope of the hi-freq. cutoff on a log scale
y   is the number of additional degrees of freedom used
z   is the amplitude of the fitted frequency range in orders of magnitude,
    or (in the case of quantum thermostat) the adimensional parameter hbar w_ref/k_B T.

 For each set of parameters, three or four files are present:
xxx_y-z.a    contains the drift matrix A_p
xxx_y-z.c    (only quantum thermostat) contains static covariance C_p
xxx_y-z.pdf  contains a "fact sheet" about the parameters
xxx_y-z.acf  contains the diagnostic quantities in raw form:

# diffusion coefficient
frequency w   \tau_h   \tau_v   \tau_kin   K(w)    H(w)    c_pp(w)     w^2 c_qq(w)   c_pq(w)[should be ~zero]


       *       Units and freq. shifting           *

 Matrices are given in scaled units, and should be properly re-scaled
to be applied to different systems. k?_ optimal-sampling parameters
are fitted over a range centered around one, while cp-?_ CPMD matrices
are fitted with the maximum ionic frequency set to one.

 The frequency scaling to be performed depends on the units expected
by the code implementing the thermostat, and on the properties of the 
system: see the relevant papers for a thorough discussion, here 
we will report a "tutorial-like" example:

For instance, say that the code expects Ap to be given in inverse picoseconds,
as ps is the unit used for the timestep. 
We want to simulate liquid water at room temperature, a system with a maximum
frequency of ~3700 cm^-1. The lowest bound can be taken from the a diffusion 
coefficient, D=2.2e-9 m^2 s^-1, or the slowest acoustic wave, which has a 
frequency of ~ 1.5 ps^-1 for a box 1nm wide.

We have therefore a maximum angular frequency of ~700 ps^-1 rad,
and a "diffusion mode" of the order of wmin=kT/mD which is ~60 ps^-1 rad.
In order not to disturb diffusion, we set the minimum frequency
to a much lower value, say ~ 7 ps^-1 rad, which is close to the one
we would have had from the sound-velocity estimate.

This means we should choose a matrix fitted over two or three orders of
magnitude in frequency, and center it around 70ps^-1 rad. Since starting
matrices are in the units of the central frequency, we may take kv_4-3.a
and multiply it by 70.


          *    Units for quantum thermostat    *

Only a minimal selection of parameters for quantum thermostatting is now 
provided. More parameters will be published on-line soon. However, the given matrix 
can be applied to a fairly general set of problems: 

naming scheme goes after
  qt-x_y
where y is the number of additional momenta, and x is the "quantum
strength parameter" x=hbar w_max/k_B T.

To use a matrix at a given temperature, one should multiply Cp by the temperature,
in energy units appropriate for a given implementation, and Ap by
w_ref=x k_B T/hbar, again in units appropriate for the host code.

The resulting dynamics will give reasonable agreement with quantum-corrected 
fluctuations for frequencies up to w_ref.
